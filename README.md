###Explanation of Outside Sources

This program makes use of the module "TextRect", which is a part of the pygame code repository.  The module, also known as "Word-wrapped text display module", was written by David Clark in 2001 and allows pygame users to render wrapped text, bound by a specified rectangle.

Pairs to Peers also uses the module "EzText", a user-submitted python library created by Jerome Rasky in 2008.  It allows pygame users to create their own text input fields.

The game also makes use of 2 sound files, all of which are licensed under either Public Domain or the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.  The sounds were downloaded in their raw MP3 form and then chopped and/or given various effects in order to make them better fit the game.  The software used for this is Audacity, which is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
